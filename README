Issues I've run into: 

- `zig` couldn't find stub sybmols. Fix: download from website.
- couldn't find symbol addresses in `lldb`. Fix: `image lookup -n main.main` for `_main.main`
- `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` when entering `startvm`. Issue: weird linking (I think that memory wasn't executable)
- Issue: zig was giving: NoSuchFile. Solution: don't force it to compile in `install` dir????
