Issues I've run into: 

- `zig` couldn't find stub sybmols. Fix: download from website.
- zig was giving: NoSuchFile. Solution: install from `brew` latest edition
- couldn't find symbol addresses in `lldb`. Fix: `image lookup -n main.main` for `_main.main`
- `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` when entering `startvm`. Issue: weird linking (I think that memory wasn't executable)
